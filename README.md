LuaPlugs 0.3
============

###What is LuaPlugs  
Oddly enough, a pack of plugins written in pure Lua.  
  
###A Brief Overview
In the LuaExt portion of this package, you'll find general utility modules and extensions of the native lua language including functions such as **math.factorial**, **table.tostring** and even safe script importing functions.
  
In the **LuaPlugs** you'll find various modules for varying applications. For example, there is a module that handles virtual help files, one that generates random names and even one that reads, alters and writes a new hybrid of human-readable text called INIPlus utilizing the INI and XML formats.  
  
###Differences in Cases
You may notice that all the **LuaExt** modules contain lower case functions. This is to match the style of the native lua functions. In my own code I use UpperCamelCase and so you'll see that in all modules _not_ found in the **LuaExt** portion of this repo.
